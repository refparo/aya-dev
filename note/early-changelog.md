# Early changelog

This file contains the changelog of the Aya language 0.x.

## 0.16

Supported import as and renaming open, supported use as infix, used new name in bin op parser,
supported rename in open command, added Primitives.aya and more tests,
removed the api module and simplified code, supported qualified projection on struct,
supported `open struct`, enhanced projection error message, allowed empty `new` block,
collected external dependencies of ctors and fields in the resolver,
infered header order together with body order and fixed sample's tyck order,
fixed simple function tycking, fixed field teles useing struct params,
used same expr tycker for same decl, supported mutual recursion on constructors and fields,
removed universe polymorphism (finally) with preparation of McBride universes and raw universe args, lsuc, lmax,
added `LiftExpr` and lift in core and `ensureUniv`, restored LittleTyper,
improved `Signatured::toString`, fixed eta severe bug,
removed unneeded method in unify, fix ctor/field dependencies on their top-level decls,
upgraded gradle, reported to codecov.

+ Added the support for Mutual recursion on constructors and fields
  + Header and body orders are generated at the same time, which is done by recording the part (header or body) where the resolver is working on.
  + Constructors and fields are treated as top-level definitions during resolving and tyck order inference.
  + Expr Resolver now has a hierarchical structure since we will treat ctors' and fields' dependencies as the body dependencies of the corresponding data and struct.
+ Overhauled the level system
  + remove universe polymorphism
  + remove `lmax`, `lsuc`, etc. things in concrete and surface
  + prepare for McBride universe liftings
  + implement McBride universe (even cruder stratification)
+ Resolved projection early
  + Struct fields are resolved in the resolver instead of the tycker.
  + Structs can be `open`ed like `data`s.
  + Fields can be projected by qualified names like `p.Paths::at`


## 0.15

Supported command line module path and load libraries, set `resolveInfo` in module loader,
created `GenericAyaParser` as an interface for `AyaProducer` where the implementation
becomes `AyaParserImpl` (so we can decouple `parser` with `base`), used adaptive terminal
style in CLI, fix jlink builds, added more unit tests, refactored unify (see below),
generalized `LocalCtx` over implementation of the variable mapping,
improved `visitDataCall` on normalization, normalize when building subst for
constructors, supported `"` in prompts, renamed `impossible` with `()`, improved
code in lib, , nuked `BinOpCollector`, deleted `Pat::type`, `Tuple::type`, `Prim::type`,
`Absurd::type`, skip `DefVar`s from skipped modules,
rewrote distillers with pattern matching.

+ Built the foundation of termination checking (thanks to @imkiva).
+ New features in the language server:
  + Show type on hover, many UX improvements on error messages.
  + Handle file creation and deletion events.
  + Search definition in the whole library.
  + Added goto def. for module and import commands.
  + Highlight occurrences based on resolution.
+ Tools: distinguish `suc` and `sucMut` in mutable graph.
+ Unification improvements:
  + Avoid creating new local variables, which might be introduced into the solutions.
  + `freezeHoles` in meta solutions to avoid misleading scope-errors.
  + Delay solution on flex-flex cases where there might be ill-scoped solutions.
+ Changes to the test library:
  + Refactored many things.
  + Conversion between `List` and `Vec`.
  + Renamed `cons` to `:<`.
  + Added cubical "square".

There are also many changes in the WIP branches.

## 0.14

Upgraded some dependencies, start using our repackaged commonmark-java with jpms,
added several error reports, implemented the library system and replaced the success
test cases with a library test suite, extracted a `common` library as a prototype of
a standard library, extracted `tools-repl` subproject with the REPL command system
generalized, added prim id to `PrimCall`, added `--verbosity` flag to control the
least severe level of errors reported, removed `RefTerm::type` (and we plan to remove
the types of core patterns too) (this means we now use a lot of `LocalCtx` instances,
even in every `TyckState.Eqn`), removed `LittleTyper` because we seem to be fine even
without it (we have sufficient universe level equations), refactored the pattern matching
elaboration to be checking _all_ patterns at once and _then_ check all bodies at once,
refactored the classifier to generate a tree of classifications (instead of a flattened list),
allow mutual recursion in conditions, start using the user-configured pretty printing options
in the CLI pretty printer, insert more obvious implicit arguments.

The library system makes use of the serialization framework
and supports file-level incremental type checking.
The language server is updated to work with the library system.

## 0.13

Upgraded gradle, resolve pattern matching in the resolver instead of the type checker,
moved some code (source locations and generalized tree builder) to `tools`,
generalized the binop parser into `tools`, implemented binop in patterns,
several bug fixes of the distiller, actually use the `opaque` (renamed from `erased`)
and `inline` modifiers in unfolder, improved the parser for literate inline codeblocks,
disable overlapping patterns in function definitions by default (still enabled for conditions),
use first-match semantics on non-overlapping patterns, enabled overlapping patterns with `overlap`
modifier, improved index unification, added support for forced patterns (see [index-unification.md]),
replaced a lot of visitors with pattern matching, inline `as` in patterns during type checking,
added experimental `variable` keyword which is similar to the one in Agda (it lacks several
desirable features such as referring to a generalized variable from a generalized variable),
use `ErrorExpr` instead of `null` for unspecified result type of primitive definitions.

The most notable improvement would be the generalized binary operator parser in `tools`.
It should be _very useful_ to PL implementers using Java 17.

## 0.12

Actually implemented the inference of type checking ordering,
extracted some tools from `base` to `tools`, allow emission of `Type 0`
in data declarations, suppressed some unnecessary errors, improved
'unresolved meta' error message with a description of their location,
enhanced pretty printing (for `new` expressions, binary operators,
reduced unnecessary parentheses and added necessary parentheses,
eta-contract def-calls), added error message for unknown fields,
make the latex backend automatically insert `\noindent`,
removed jimgui-based tracer (moved to test) for smaller fatJars,
fixed no-arg constructor pattern matching, improved coverage checker
(fixed a divergence case, added fuel for impossible cases elimination),
fixed pattern checker when there are more implicit parameters omitted
in the patterns, added `compareApprox` in `compareUntyped`,
removed `abusing` syntax, refactor `bind` syntax, use the REPL for
pretty-printing options configuration.

Publish the `lsp` module.

## 0.11

Enhanced repl: completion, command system, command parser based on antlr,
tests, cd/pwd/load/etc. commands, redefinitions, highlighting, etc.

Tycking now stores state (term/level equations, solved metas)
in `TyckState` so in the future we may save/restore it.

Some LSP bug fixes, a new 'domination' warning suggested by [@nobodxbodon],
avoid tycking bodies when patterns are malformed, finished all easy
pattern matching to visitor replacements, enhance binop parser with section support,
generate Aya syntax highlight YML during build, Kala-relevant refactoring.
